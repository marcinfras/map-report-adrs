# Architecture Decision Records – map-report

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the **map-report** project.

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made during the project, along with its context and consequences.  
The format follows Michael Nygard's ADR style.

## How to navigate
- See [index.md](index.md) for a chronological list of all decisions.
- Each ADR has:
  - A unique number (starting from 0001)
  - A title describing the decision
  - Status (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, or Deprecated)

## How to create a new ADR
1. Copy the last ADR number and increment it (e.g., 0002-new-decision.md).
2. Use the ADR template (Context → Decision → Consequences).
3. Update `index.md` with a link to the new ADR.
